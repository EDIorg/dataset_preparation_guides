# EDI Community Dataset Preparation Guides

A repository for metadata best practices and formatting guides for preparing research datasets for publication.

This content here was originally taken from EDI's [*Data Package Best Practices*](https://ediorg.github.io/data-package-best-practices/) site ([repo](https://github.com/EDIorg/data-package-best-practices))

and reformatted as a collection of [Quarto books](https://quarto.org/docs/books). Revisions of these guides, which are underway, will be added here.

## Published versions

* [The current production version of the books](https://ediorg.github.io/dataset_preparation_guides/)
* The pre-release version of the books (to come, probably on netlify)
